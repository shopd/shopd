[View models](https://templ.guide/core-concepts/view-models/)

Naming convention is to have files corresponding to the first path element of the api or content, e.g. `login.go`. Content models are named the same as the path, and API models append the method, i.e. `type Login` and `type LoginGet`

For use with the *"templ views"* in api, components, and content
